# nicks_intervals

This is a port of my python libray (See [NicksIntervals](https://github.com/thehappycheese/NicksIntervals)) mostly for the purpose of learning Rust. 

For certain usecases this library would benefit from the speed boost that Rust would give it. Even a naive implementation should run heaps faster than python for large datasets. If all goes well, maybe I will look into python bindings, or perhaps even a web-assembly build.
