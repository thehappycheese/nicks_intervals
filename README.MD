# nicks_intervals

This is a port of my python libray (See [NicksIntervals](https://github.com/thehappycheese/NicksIntervals) for more information.) mostly for the purpose of learning how to use Rust. 

This library could definitly stand to benefit from the speed boost that rust would give it, even with a naieve implementation it should run heaps faster than python for opperations on large datasets. If all goes well, maybe I will look into python bindings, or perhaps even a web-assembly build.
